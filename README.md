# Stellar-To-Do-List
## An Immersive 3D To-Do List with Geolocation &amp; Time-Rewind Effects.

Introduction Stellar Tasks is a next-generation To-Do List application that transforms mundane task management into an interstellar experience. Unlike standard productivity tools, this project integrates a real-time 3D Earth utilizing Three.js, which automatically synchronizes with the user's geolocation to center the view on their region (e.g., Taiwan/East Asia).

The application is built with a focus on "Gamified Productivity." Completing a task triggers a satisfying particle explosion, while restoring a task initiates a unique "Time-Rewind" animation, visually reassembling the task item from stardust.

<p>&emsp;&emsp;Core Features

✅ Smart Task Management:

<p>&emsp;&emsp;Essential To-Do functionalities: Add, delete, and schedule tasks.

<p>&emsp;&emsp;Strict Validation: Prevents task creation without valid time coordinates.

<p>&emsp;&emsp;Browser Notifications: Sends system alerts when a scheduled task is due.

🌍 Interactive 3D Earth:

<p>&emsp;&emsp;Powered by Three.js, rendering a high-fidelity Earth with atmospheric glow and floating clouds.

<p>&emsp;&emsp;Auto-Geolocation: Detects user IP to automatically rotate the globe to their specific longitude (optimized for Taiwan/East Asia visibility).

<p>&emsp;&emsp;Interactive Controls: Users can manually drag and rotate the Earth to explore different view angles.

✨ Visual & UX Excellence:

<p>&emsp;&emsp;Tenet-style Rewind: A custom animation that simulates reversing time when unchecking a task.

<p>&emsp;&emsp;Glassmorphism UI: Modern, translucent interface design that blends seamlessly with the dynamic nebula background.
